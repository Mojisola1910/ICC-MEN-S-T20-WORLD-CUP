# ICC MEN'S T20 WORLD CUP
The 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup was the ninth edition of the tournament, co-hosted by the West Indies and the United States from June 2 to June 29, 2024. This marked the second time West Indies hosted the event and the first major ICC tournament to feature matches in the United States. The tournament expanded from 16 to 20 teams, including the two hosts, the top eight teams from the 2022 edition, the two highest-ranked teams in the ICC Men's T20I Team Rankings not already qualified, and eight teams determined by regional qualifiers. Notably, Canada and Uganda qualified for the men's T20 World Cup for the first time, and the United States participated by virtue of being co-hosts. England, the defending champions, were defeated by India in the semi-finals. India went on to win their second T20 World Cup title by defeating South Africa by 7 runs, equaling the record for most titles held by England and the West Indies.
